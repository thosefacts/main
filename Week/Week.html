                    Japan's PM Shinzo Abe has recently been receiving backlash over his dealing with the Corona crisis. 
                    Some Japanese find the PM's countermeasures too nonchalant and fear that corona infections will skyrocket soon |
                    Yesterday, people criticized Abe for twittering a photo in which he seemed 'too relaxed' while others were 'fighting for their lives' | 
                    Today, Tokyo's governor delivered <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-japan-koike/tokyo-governor-koike-a-pm-abe-rival-takes-tough-stance-on-coronavirus-idUSKCN21V0EI">a speech</a>
                    calling on people to stay at home - in clash with Abe's less urging policy.

                 Shortly after making office, the head of the Hong Kong liaison office Luo Huining delivered a speech urging the authorities to pass a national security legislation law 'as soon as possible'. The law directs itself mostly to Hong Kong, which had remained rather independent of China | A law of similar nature (known as Article 23) was met with massive demonstrations in Hong Kong last year, because the citizens saw China's efforts as treacherous: Hong Kong conjoined with mainland China in 1997 under the condition of 'one country, two systems'.
