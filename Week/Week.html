                    Japan's PM Shinzo Abe has recently been receiving backlash over his dealing with the Corona crisis. 
                    Some Japanese find the PM's countermeasures too nonchalant and fear that corona infections will skyrocket soon |
                    Yesterday, people criticized Abe for twittering a photo in which he seemed 'too relaxed' while others were 'fighting for their lives' | 
                    Today, Tokyo's governor delivered <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-japan-koike/tokyo-governor-koike-a-pm-abe-rival-takes-tough-stance-on-coronavirus-idUSKCN21V0EI">a speech</a>
                    calling on people to stay at home - in clash with Abe's less urging policy.

                        It recently begot much popularity worldwide | China banned sales after noticing Hong Kongese used the game to continue <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-08/nintendo-s-animal-crossing-becomes-new-hong-kong-protest-ground">protests against the Chinese government</a> | To note, it is somewhat common for China to ban the sale of specific games.
