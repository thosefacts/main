                    Japan's PM Shinzo Abe has recently been receiving backlash over his dealing with the Corona crisis. 
                    Some Japanese find the PM's countermeasures too nonchalant and fear that corona infections will skyrocket soon |
                    Yesterday, people criticized Abe for twittering a photo in which he seemed 'too relaxed' while others were 'fighting for their lives' | 
                    Today, Tokyo's governor delivered <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-japan-koike/tokyo-governor-koike-a-pm-abe-rival-takes-tough-stance-on-coronavirus-idUSKCN21V0EI">a speech</a>
                    calling on people to stay at home - in clash with Abe's less urging policy.

                    China promises it has not covered up elements of the <b>Corona outbreak</b></span> Yesterday, the US president said his country will investigate the origin of the Corona virus; whether it was artificially made in a Chinese lab. Trump also said that the WHO and China likely withheld information and could have informed the world about Covid-19's existence weeks before than they did. China's foreign minister responded, saying that China has not covered up any elements of the Corona outbreak | China controversially increased their Corona death toll by a sheer 50% for the city of Wuhan, adding to doubts about China's accuracy in reporting information.
