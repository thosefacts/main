                            Yesterday, the US president said his country will investigate the origin of the Corona virus; whether it was artificially made in a Chinese lab.

China's foreign minister responded, saying that China has not covered up any elements of the Corona outbreak | China controversially increased their Corona death toll by a sheer 50% for the city of Wuhan, adding to doubts about China's accuracy in reporting information.
