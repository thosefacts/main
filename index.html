                        Yesterday, people criticized Abe for twittering a photo in which he seemed 'too relaxed' while others were 'fighting for their lives' | 
                        Today, Tokyo's governor delivered <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-japan-koike/tokyo-governor-koike-a-pm-abe-rival-takes-tough-stance-on-coronavirus-idUSKCN21V0EI">a speech</a>
                        calling on people to stay at home - in clash with Abe's less urging policy.
