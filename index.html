                        The USA and Taliban had already made the February pact, agreeing on de-escalation and the gradual removal of US military personnel.

                    <p>
                        The agreement came amid heated discussions between EU-members. Some leaders state this deal paves the way for the creation of Eurobonds, a joint debt softening obligation interests for weaker member states. Members as IT and FR quarrel with NL, GE, FIN and AU, with the NL and IT being particularly polarized and animated.

                        51 people who recovered from the Corona virus were reported to have their symptons recur | Korean officials claimed the virus might have been reactivated, but virologists deem that unlikely.
